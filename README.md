Decision tree regression examines an object's characteristics and trains a model in the shape of a tree to forecast future data and create meaningful continuous output. The output/result is not discrete because it is not represented solely by a known set of discrete values.
Example of a discrete output - A cricket-match prediction model that determines whether a particular team wins or not.
Example of continuous output - A sales forecasting model that predicts the profit margins that a company would gain over a financial year based on past values.

DecisionTreeClassifier is a machine learning model based on decision tree algorithms. Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. (continuous and categorical output variables)

Classification Task:
DecisionTreeClassifier is specifically designed for classification tasks, where the goal is to assign a label (class) to each input sample.
In your case, the model is learning to classify instances into different categories based on the input features.

max_depth Parameter:
The max_depth parameter controls the maximum depth of the decision tree. It limits the number of nodes in the tree, which can help prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and outliers that do not generalize well to new, unseen data.

Training:
The fit method is used to train the model. During training, the algorithm learns the optimal decision rules based on the input features and their corresponding target labels.
The decision tree is constructed by recursively splitting the data until a stopping criterion is met (such as reaching the maximum depth or having a subset with homogenous labels).

Prediction: predictions = clf.predict(new_data)
After training, the model can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data using the predict method. The decision tree uses the learned rules to traverse the tree and assign a class label to each input sample.

Interpretability:
One advantage of decision trees is their interpretability. You can visualize the decision tree to understand the decision-making process, making it easier to interpret and explain the model's predictions.
